    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This study examines eviction patterns across Census Tracts using descriptive statistics. By calculating key metrics such as mean, median, quartiles, and standard deviation, we quantify disparities in eviction counts across geographic areas. The analysis highlights significant variability, with certain Census Tracts experiencing extreme eviction rates while others remain largely unaffected. The findings provide a statistical foundation for understanding eviction trends without integrating socioeconomic or spatial visualization components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question:**\n",
    "How do eviction counts vary across Census Tracts, and what do statistical patterns reveal about the distribution of evictions?"

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This study examines eviction trends using Census Tract-level eviction counts alongside statewide eviction warrant records for Maryland (2022–2024). The dataset originates from the District Court of Maryland and Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), and includes address-level eviction filings, which were processed in a structured directory to ensure compliance with data privacy best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis employs Python and key libraries such as pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, and folium, facilitating geospatial and statistical operations. Due to ethical data considerations, address-level records were not publicly stored or committed to version control. Additionally, AI-assisted tools—including ChatGPT and Copilot—were consulted throughout the coding process for debugging, optimization, and methodological refinement."

    "# Preliminary Data Preparation\n",
    "To prepare the Maryland eviction warrant records through 2024 **(N=411,040)** for geocoding and spatial analysis, addresses were geocoded using the Census Geocoder to enable accurate mapping, spatial joins, and geographic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loaded the eviction warrants dataset and ensured ZIP codes were properly formatted as strings.\n",
    "- Extracted 167,949 unique addresses from the 411,040 records to minimize redundant geocoding.\n",
    "- Split the addresses into 17 CSV files (each <10,000 rows) for batch geocoding.\n",
    "- Used the Census Geocoder API to geocode all address chunks and recombined results.\n",
    "- Merged geocoded results back onto the full eviction records using address fields.\n",
    "- Converted the resulting dataset to a GeoDataFrame with lon, lat, and geometry columns.\n",
    "- 94.6% of records received valid geocodes, and 56.0% were exact matches."

    "# Section 2: Assessing Eviction Records Geocoding Accuracy Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The geocoding accuracy of the Maryland eviction warrant dataset was assessed and potential biases related to eviction types and counties were examined. The analysis revealed significant biases in geocoding accuracy related to both eviction types and counties. These biases suggest that urban areas (Baltimore City, Montgomery, and Prince George's) and certain types of eviction events tend to have higher geocoding accuracy, whereas rural areas and other eviction types face more challenges with accurate geocoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Missing Data**: No missing data were detected in critical columns, ensuring that the dataset was complete for analysis.\n",
    "2. **Geometry Handling**: Missing geometries were successfully addressed by converting latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates into point geometries for all records, ensuring valid geospatial data.\n",
    "3. **Geocoding Accuracy**: The analysis showed varying levels of geocoding accuracy across different eviction types and counties:\n",
    "   - Eviction types such as \"Warrant of Restitution - Return of Service - Expired\" had slightly lower accuracy, while others like \"Petition - For Warrant of Restitution Filed\" exhibited higher accuracy.\n",
    "   - Geocoding accuracy also varied by county, with urban counties generally showing higher accuracy compared to rural counties.\n",
    "4. **Chi-Square Test Results**: \n",
    "   - The Chi-square test for eviction type bias yielded a p-value of 0.0000, indicating a significant relationship between eviction type and geocoding accuracy.\n",
    "   - The Chi-square test for county bias also produced a p-value of 0.0000, indicating a significant relationship between county and geocoding accuracy."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The eviction analysis reveals significant disparities across Census Tracts, with highly uneven distributions of eviction counts. While 25% of Census Tracts had 16 or fewer evictions, others experienced thousands, indicating extreme clustering in certain areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of outlier Census Tracts with exceptionally high eviction counts underscores the need for targeted policy interventions, including tenant protections and affordability initiatives in high-risk areas. Additionally, the stark contrast between mean (263.67) and median (74.0) eviction counts suggests that a small subset of tracts disproportionately drive the overall eviction rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Follow-Up Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Future studies should normalize eviction rates by renter population, housing density, or median income, allowing deeper insights into systemic economic and policy drivers behind eviction trends. Additional research could explore transit accessibility, zoning restrictions, and rental affordability to determine if high eviction rates correlate with urban development policies. Finally, incorporating tenant surveys or legal case outcomes would provide a more holistic view of eviction causes and long-term housing instability."
